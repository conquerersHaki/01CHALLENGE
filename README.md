# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Here we were given a source code to a website and were asked to refactor and improve accessibility.

    -This source code originally could have used some improvement when it came to accessibility and readability. I wanted to make the code and the site
        more accessible when it came to several aspects. Some links were fixed, images were given alt names and some semantic elements were added to
        be hopefully more readable. I was able to learn a lot in applying what I've learned so far.

## INSTALLATION
    -To access the code itself, simply clone the repository from my GitHub account and open it in Visual Studio Code. Either that or you can open the 
        link to the page and inspect using Chrome Devtools (right click any space and select inspect).

## USAGE
    -This site provides insight on multiple aspects of the internet, social media and working in the digital world. You can navigate to different areas
        of this page by using the navigation bar in the top right and clicking on the subject you would like to read.

## CREDITS
    -The original code comes from the repository urban-octo-telegram from George Yoo (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram)
